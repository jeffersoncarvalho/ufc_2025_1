        <h1>Hadean Eon</h1>
        <p>
          The Hadean Eon is the oldest eon in Earth's history,
          <strong>dating from about 4.6 billion to 4.0 billion years ago</strong
          >. During this period, the Earth was characterized by a partially
          molten surface, intense volcanism, and frequent asteroid impacts. The
          planet was incredibly hot due to gravitational compression,
          radioactive decay, and asteroid impacts, and much of this heat still
          exists inside the Earth today
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hadean Eon marks the time of Earth's initial formation, including
          the accretion of dust and gases, collisions with larger bodies, and
          the stabilization of its core and crust. The atmosphere and oceans
          also began to form during this period.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evidence suggests that liquid water may have been present on Earth as
          early as 4.4 billion years ago, and there might even be indications of
          life existing over 4.0 billion years ago, although the most reliable
          record for early life, the microfossil record, starts at 3.5 billion
          years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hadean Eon ended approximately 4.031 billion years ago and was
          succeeded by the Archean Eon. The formation of the Moon, which is
          thought to have occurred due to a collision between Earth and a
          Mars-sized body, is believed to have happened during the early stages
          of the Hadean Eon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rocks from the Hadean Eon are very rare, with most of the available
          evidence coming from zircon grains found in the Jack Hills of Western
          Australia.

        <h1>Archean Eon</h1>
        <p>
          The Archean Eon is the second of the four geologic eons of Earth's
          history, <strong>lasting from 4.031 to 2.5 billion years ago</strong>.
          It is named after the Greek word for beginning, arkhē. This eon is
          significant for the appearance of the earliest known life forms,
          primarily represented by shallow-water microbial mats called
          stromatolites, which remained simple prokaryotes throughout the eon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Earth during the Archean was mostly covered by water, with
          continental crust existing but mostly submerged under deep oceans. The
          atmosphere was a reducing atmosphere rich in methane and lacking free
          oxygen, with oxygen levels as low as 0.00001% of modern levels.
          However, transient episodes of heightened oxygenation occurred around
          2,980–2,960 Ma, 2,700 Ma, and 2,501 Ma.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Archean Eon is subdivided into four eras: the Eoarchean (4031 to
          3600 Mya), Paleoarchean (3600 to 3200 Mya), Mesoarchean (3200 to 2800
          Mya), and Neoarchean (2800 to 2500 Mya
        </p>
        <p>
          The beginning of the Archean Eon is marked by the Late Heavy
          Bombardment, an event where a large spike of asteroids and comets
          impacted the Earth and Moon, creating many of the Moon's craters.

          <p>
            The Eoarchean (IPA: /ˌiːoʊ.ɑːrˈkiːən/ EE-oh-ar-KEE-ən; also spelled
            Eoarchaean) is the first era of the Archean Eon of the geologic
            record. It spans 431 million years, from the end of the Hadean Eon
            4031 Mya to the start of the Paleoarchean Era 3600 Mya. Some
            estimates place the beginnings of life on Earth in this era, while
            others place it earlier. Evidence of archaea and cyanobacteria date
            to 3500 Mya, comparatively shortly after the Eoarchean. At that
            time, the atmosphere was without oxygen and the pressure values
            ranged from 10 to 100 bar (around 10 to 100 times the atmospheric
            pressure today)
          </p>
          <h2>Paleoarchean Era</h2>
          <p>
            The Paleoarchean (/ˌpeɪlioʊ.ɑːrˈkiːən, ˌpæl-/ PAY-lee-oh-ar-KEE-ən,
            PAL-), also spelled Palaeoarchaean (formerly known as the early
            Archean), is a geologic era within the Archean Eon. The name derives
            from Greek "Palaios" ancient. It spans the period of time 3,600 to
            3,200 million years ago. The era is defined chronometrically and is
            not referenced to a specific level of a rock section on Earth. The
            earliest confirmed evidence of life comes from this era, and
            Vaalbara, one of Earth's earliest supercontinents, may have formed
            during this era.

            first evidence of modern-style plate subduction and expansion of

        <h1>Proterozoic Eon</h1>
        <p>
          The Proterozoic Eon is a significant period in Earth's history,
          <strong>spanning from 2.5 billion to 541 million years ago</strong>,
          marking the second division of the Precambrian time and preceding the
          Phanerozoic Eon. This eon is characterized by profound changes in the
          planet's atmosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere, setting the stage for
          the complex life forms that would emerge in subsequent eras. During
          the Proterozoic, modern plate tectonics became active, and the ancient
          cores of the continents moved over wide areas of the globe,
          accumulating smaller fragments of crust and sometimes colliding with
          other large landmasses. The Proterozoic is often divided into three
          distinct eras: the Paleoproterozoic (2.5 to 1.6 billion years ago),
          Mesoproterozoic (1.6 to 1 billion years ago), and Neoproterozoic (1
          billion to 541 million years ago).
        </p>
        <p>
          Each era is marked by unique geological and biological developments,
          including the gradual accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere and the
          emergence of multicellular organisms

          <p>
            The Paleoproterozoic Era (also spelled Palaeoproterozoic) is the
            first of the three sub-divisions (eras) of the Proterozoic eon, and
            also the longest era of the Earth's geological history, spanning
            from 2,500 to 1,600 million years ago (2.5–1.6 Ga). It is further
            subdivided into four geologic periods, namely the Siderian,
            Rhyacian, Orosirian and Statherian.

            The Mesoproterozoic Era[4] is a geologic era that occurred from
            1,600 to 1,000 million years ago. The Mesoproterozoic was the first
            era of Earth's history for which a fairly definitive geological
            record survives. Continents existed during the preceding era (the
            Paleoproterozoic), but little is known about them. The continental
            masses of the Mesoproterozoic were more or less the same ones that
            exist today, although their arrangement on the Earth's surface was
            different.

            ago,[2] and is the last era of the Precambrian "supereon". It is
            preceded by the Mesoproterozoic era and succeeded by the Paleozoic

        <h1>Phanerozoic Eon</h1>
        <p>
          The Phanerozoic Eon is the current and most recent geological eon,
          spanning approximately 541 million years from the present to the end
          of the Proterozoic Eon. It is characterized by the proliferation and
          diversification of abundant animal and plant life on Earth. The term
          "Phanerozoic" is derived from the Ancient Greek words φανερός
          (phanerós), meaning "visible," and ζωή (zōḗ), meaning "life,"
          reflecting the eon's rich fossil record
        </p>
        <p>
          The Phanerozoic is divided into three major eras: the Paleozoic,
          Mesozoic, and Cenozoic, each marked by distinct geological and
          biological developments. The Paleozoic Era, or "ancient life," began
          541 million years ago and ended 252 million years ago. The Mesozoic
          Era, or "middle life," lasted from 252 million to 66 million years
          ago. The Cenozoic Era, or "recent life," began 66 million years ago
          and continues to the present.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Phanerozoic Eon is significant because it marks the transition
          from largely sessile Precambrian biota to the active mobile life forms
          of the Cambrian period and beyond. The Cambrian Explosion, which
          occurred at the beginning of the Phanerozoic, saw a massive
          biodiversification of multicellular organisms. Since the systematic
          study of the Ediacaran period began in the 1950s, trace fossils of
          complex soft-bodied metazoa from this period have been identified,
          indicating that complex life existed at least since the Tonian period
          of the Proterozoic eon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Phanerozoic Eon represents only about 12% of Earth's total
          history, with the remaining 88% being the Precambrian eons (Hadean,
          Archean, and Proterozoic).

          <p>
            The Paleozoic (/ˌpæli.əˈzoʊ.ɪk, -i.oʊ-, ˌpeɪ-/ PAL-ee-ə-ZOH-ik,
            -⁠ee-oh-, PAY-;[1] or Palaeozoic) Era is the first of three
            geological eras of the Phanerozoic Eon. Beginning 538.8 million
            years ago (Ma), it succeeds the Neoproterozoic (the last era of the
            Proterozoic Eon) and ends 251.9 Ma at the start of the Mesozoic
            Era.[2] The Paleozoic is subdivided into six geologic periods (from
            oldest to youngest), Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian,
            Carboniferous and Permian. Some geological timescales divide the
            Paleozoic informally into early and late sub-eras: the Early
            Paleozoic consisting of the Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian; the
            Late Paleozoic consisting of the Devonian, Carboniferous and
            Permian.
          </p>
          <h2>Mesozoic Era</h2>
          <p>
            The Mesozoic Era[3] is the era of Earth's geological history,
            lasting from about 252 to 66 million years ago, comprising the
            Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. It is characterized by
            the dominance of archosaurian reptiles such as the dinosaurs, and of
            gymnosperms such as cycads, ginkgoaceae and araucarian conifers; a
            hot greenhouse climate; and the tectonic break-up of Pangaea. The
            Mesozoic is the middle of the three eras since complex life evolved:
            the Paleozoic, the Mesozoic, and the Cenozoic.
          </p>
          <h2>Cenozoic Era</h2>
          <p>
            The Cenozoic Era (/ˌsiːnəˈzoʊ.ɪk, ˌsɛn-/ SEE-nə-ZOH-ik,
            SEN-ə-;[1][2] lit. 'new life') is Earth's current geological era,
            representing the last 66 million years of Earth's history. It is
            characterized by the dominance of mammals, insects, birds and
            angiosperms (flowering plants). It is the latest of three geological
            eras of the Phanerozoic Eon, preceded by the Mesozoic and Paleozoic.
            The Cenozoic started with the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event,
            when many species, including the non-avian dinosaurs, became extinct
            in an event attributed by most experts to the impact of a large
            asteroid or other celestial body, the Chicxulub impactor.
